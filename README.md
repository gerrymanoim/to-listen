# To Listen

A `To Listen` Queue Manager and a GCloud test Project

## Todo 

- [ ] Open Source this
  - [ ] Clean up the firebase DB rules
  - [ ] Clean up the very bad auth code
  - [X] Auth uses uids instead of emaisl
  - [ ] Clean up the entire `main.py` flow - we need some classes
  - [X] Make this look like not a pile of hot garbage.
- [ ] Add documentation
  - [ ] Infra diagram 
  - [ ] Configuration options/locations
- [ ] Github actions
- [ ] Clean up sign out flow, currently id blows up
- [ ] Figure out how to put all the gcloud configuration/setup as code/scripts
